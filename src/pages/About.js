          Here is my songsaver app. <br />
          You can save your favorite songs on this page!
          <br />
          If for some reason you don't like the song or artist anymore you can
          always delete a song or, empty the list and start over.
          <br /> <br />
          Even tho React makes FED a little easier the struggle is real. It's
          hard to grasp everything shot at you. <br />
          It feels as if people explaining to you what a door is and expect you
          to build a house. <br />
          Hard work, endless Google-ing and determination helps. (a bit)
          <br />
          <br />
          If anyone ever sees this that follows a FED course... GOOD LUCK!!!
